# rockGen
A simple tool to generate rocks, created as for my master thesis project. Tool allows a creation of 3d rock objects.

The code was written using:
Python 3.8.8
Open3D 0.13.0
Noise 1.2.2

As such those are required to start it. I can't guarantee that program will start if other versions of following packages were used.
